## Example of a server-client connection using React, Express, and Node

This is the work of "Arpan Neupane" from youtube. Video found here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3vs4a03y3I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3vs4a03y3I)

#### To install:

1. Change directory into `react-server-client/server`
2. Install with npm: `npm install`
3. Change directory into `react-server-client/client`
4. Install with npm: `npm install`

#### To run:

1. Start the server
   Change directory into `react-server-client/server`
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open a second terminal and change directory into `react-server-client/client`
4. Run: `npm start`
   This should automatically open a window to `localhost:3000` with three usernames (userOne, userTwo, and userThree) listed vertically (not in plain text, this should be showing as html).
